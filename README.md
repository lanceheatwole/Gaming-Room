# Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a client who had a successful web app called Draw It or Lose It. The app was a game where players would attempt to guess what image was being rendered by the computer. It began as simply an Android app, but The Gaming Room wanted to expand the app to Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did very well developing the software design document. I broke down the design constraints that would be necessary for the app. I evaluated hardware and software needs for The Gaming Room to host their new software, and then made my recommendations to that effect.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It was helpful to know what kind of constraints would be necessary to code for. It was also helpful in determining the kinds of APIs necessary for the security of the application and system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the overall code that was made for the application. I believe it's not as efficient as it could have been and with a little more work it could be simpler and more streamlined. Especially the code for the rest API.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user is ultimately the one who will be using the software. While it is important to design for ease of maintenance and working on the code, the user's opinions and needs should always be taken into account since that's really who were are developing the software for in the end. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing a UML diagram was very helpful. It served as a good outline for the project. It felt a lot like a roadmap that I was following to create the application piece by piece which I think helped make it more successful.
